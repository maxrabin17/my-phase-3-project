## Contact Book App
Welcome to my Contact Book App! This is an app which allows a user to Sign up and Login to their own personal contact book. Within the contact book, a user can add contacts with their Address, Name, and Phone number. This app is simple to use, and is my first app using Ruby with Rack. 

*Unfortunately I am having difficulties with deploying this app through Heroku. In the meantime, feel free to clone down my repo and follow the steps below!*

## Usage
- Open new terminal and changed directory (cd) into the "backend" folder with the "my-phase-3-project" folder.
- Run `bundle install`
